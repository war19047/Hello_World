# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

I am trying to learn how to use Git and Github in sync with Visual Studio Code. This program is intended to give me experience using this particular version control.

{Provide a description of your software}

My software introduces myself to the world of coding. I have just set up version control on my IDE and this program is intended to be an icebreaker into using version control. 

{Describe your purpose for creating this software.}
The purpose of this software is to introduce myself on Github as well as to become familiar using this technology.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
